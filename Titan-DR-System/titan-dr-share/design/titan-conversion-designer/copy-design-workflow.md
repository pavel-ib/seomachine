PHASE 1: COPY ANALYSIS (Titan DR)
User brief → Awareness level + Dominant bias + Hook + Copy text
        ↓
PHASE 2: DESIGN BRIEF (Titan Conversion Designer)
Copy signal → Visual pattern + Color + Layout + Reference images from index
        ↓
PHASE 3: GENERATION (Gemini)
Design brief + Reference images → Generated base ad image (no text)
        ↓
PHASE 4: COMPOSITE (HTML Templates / ImageMagick)
Base image + Copy text → Final ad with headline, offer strip, CTA overlay
        ↓
PHASE 5: QA (Checklist)
Final ad → Verified against Design Brief → Ship
```

## PHASE 1 — COPY ANALYSIS

**Load**: Titan DR (`titan-psychology.md` + `titan-language.md` + relevant format file)

**Input**: User's product description, target audience, ad objective

**Process**:
1. Assign Schwartz awareness level (L1–L5)
2. Assign sophistication stage (S1–S5)
3. Identify dominant bias to exploit
4. Select hook type (from 21 hook types in `titan-hook-library.md`)
5. Write hero hook + headline + body copy + CTA text

**Output** (hand to Phase 2):
```
COPY SIGNAL:
- Product: [name]
- Audience: [avatar description]
- Awareness Level: L[N] — [what they know]
- Sophistication Stage: S[N]
- Dominant Bias: [bias name]
- Hook Type: [type from hook library]

COPY TEXT:
- Headline (on-image): [3-8 words, all caps]
- Subhead (optional): [8-15 words]
- Offer text (if applicable): [e.g., "70% OFF TODAY ONLY"]
- CTA button: [text + color suggestion]
- Ad body copy: [full text for the ad body field]
```

## PHASE 2 — DESIGN BRIEF

**Load**: `SKILL.md` + `design-psychology.md` + `visual-patterns.md`

**Input**: Copy Signal + Copy Text from Phase 1

**Process**:
1. Map awareness level → layout type (using Quick Mapping table in SKILL.md)
2. Map sophistication stage → design complexity
3. Map dominant bias → color/visual signal
4. Map hook type → image category
5. Select pattern from `visual-patterns.md` that matches all signals
6. **Query `pattern-reference-index.json`** for matching reference images:
   - Filter to selected pattern_id
   - Sort by used_count DESC
   - Prefer brand diversity (different brands in top 2-3)
   - Match product niche if possible
7. Write the full Design Brief

**Output** (hand to Phase 3):
```
DESIGN BRIEF — [Product/Campaign Name]

Copy Signal: [from Phase 1]

Layout:
- Pattern: [Pattern # and name from visual-patterns.md]
- Structure: [e.g., "Full-bleed product hero, text overlay bottom third"]
- Rationale: [1 sentence — why this pattern matches the copy signal]

Color Palette:
- Background: [hex or descriptor]
- Accent/CTA: [hex or descriptor]
- Typography: [light/dark/colored]
- Rationale: [1 sentence — psychology reason]

Visual Hierarchy (top to bottom):
1. [Element] — [size/weight]
2. [Element]
3. [Element]

Face/Person:
- Include: Yes/No
- If yes: [age, gender, emotional state, eye direction]
- Rationale: [conversion reason]

Product Placement: [Hero / Supporting / Absent] — [placement]

CTA Button: [color] — [text] — [placement]

Reference Images (from pattern-reference-index.json):
- [filename1.jpg] — [brand], used_count: [N]
- [filename2.jpg] — [brand], used_count: [N]

Gemini Prompt (ready to execute):
[Full Gemini text prompt — NO text in image, base visual only]
```

---

## PHASE 3 — GENERATION

**Load**: `gemini-image-gen/SKILL.md` + `references/gemini-multimodal.md`

**Input**: Design Brief from Phase 2 (including reference image filenames)

**Process**:
1. Load 2-3 reference images from `~/Downloads/Workforce/ad-library-v5/images/` as base64
2. Write payload to temp file (images are too large for CLI args)
3. Build multimodal Gemini prompt:
   - [TEXT]: "These are examples of high-performing DTC ads using the [PATTERN NAME] pattern:"
   - [IMAGE 1]: First reference image (highest used_count)
   - [IMAGE 2]: Second reference image (different brand if possible)
   - [TEXT]: Full Design Brief with generation instructions
   - [TEXT]: "Generate only the base image. Do NOT render any text, headlines, or words on the image. Text will be added separately."
4. Call Gemini API (`gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` for speed, `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for quality)
5. Save generated image to `~/Downloads/Workforce/generated-ads/`

**Output**:
```
~/Downloads/Workforce/generated-ads/[campaign]-base.jpg
```

**Model selection:**
| Quality Need | Model | Cost |
|-------------|-------|------|
| Draft/testing | `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` | ~$0.067/image |
| Final production | `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` | ~$0.134/image |

---

## PHASE 4 — COMPOSITE

**Load**: `copy-on-image.md` + appropriate template from `templates/`

**Input**: Base image from Phase 3 + Copy Text from Phase 1

**Process**:

### Method A: HTML Template + Puppeteer (recommended for multi-element overlays)
1. Select template based on the overlay needs:
   - `templates/headline-only.html` — single headline + brand logo
   - `templates/headline-offer.html` — headline + subhead + bottom offer strip
   - `templates/review-quote.html` — star rating + review + product + offer badge
   - `templates/mechanism-callouts.html` — product + 4 callout bubbles
   - `templates/text-card.html` — full text card (no Gemini base needed)
2. Replace template variables with Copy Text values
3. Set `{{BACKGROUND_IMAGE}}` to the Phase 3 output file path
4. Screenshot with Puppeteer: `npx puppeteer screenshot template.html --width=1080 --height=1350`
5. Save as final composite

### Method B: ImageMagick (for simple single-line overlays)
```bash
magick input.png \
  -gravity North \
  -font "Montserrat-Bold" \
  -pointsize 72 \
  -fill white \
  -stroke black -strokewidth 2 \
  -annotate +0+40 "HEADLINE TEXT" \
  output.png
```

### Method C: Gemini Re-pass (fastest, less control)
Send the base image back to Gemini with: "Add text '[HEADLINE]' in white bold at the top of this image."

**Output**:
```
~/Downloads/Workforce/generated-ads/[campaign]-final.png
```

## PHASE 5 — QA CHECKLIST

Before marking the ad complete, verify:

- [ ] Design Brief includes ALL elements from the template (no gaps)
- [ ] Pattern selected from `visual-patterns.md` — not invented ad hoc
- [ ] Reference images are the highest used_count examples for that pattern
- [ ] Color decisions traced to a psychological principle (not preference)
- [ ] Face decision justified (if using, eye direction specified)
- [ ] CTA button color creates contrast against background
- [ ] Headline follows `copy-on-image.md` rules (3-8 words, correct tier)
- [ ] Generated image checked against Design Brief before compositing
- [ ] Final composite is 1080×1350 (4:5) or 1080×1080 (1:1) at minimum
- [ ] No text rendered by Gemini that should have been composited
- [ ] Meta ad policy compliance checked (see `copy-on-image.md` policy section)

## STANDALONE MODES

Each phase runs independently:

| Mode | Load | Use When |
|------|------|----------|
| Copy analysis only | Titan DR | Writing copy without visual production |
| Design brief only | This skill (Phase 2) | Briefing a human designer |
| Design audit | This skill + `design-psychology.md` | Analyzing why a competitor ad converts |
| Generation only | `gemini-image-gen/SKILL.md` | Already have a design brief |
| Composite only | `copy-on-image.md` + templates | Have a base image, need overlays |

---

## WORKED EXAMPLE

**User brief**: "Create a Facebook ad for SurviveX Large First Aid Kit targeting preparedness-minded men 28-45 who are family providers"

### Phase 1 Output
```
COPY SIGNAL:
- Product: SurviveX Large First Aid Kit ($120.99, 250 components)
- Audience: Men 28-45, family providers, want to be prepared for emergencies
- Awareness Level: L3 — Solution-aware (knows first aid kits exist, comparing options)
- Sophistication Stage: S3 — Feature-fatigued (seen generic kits, needs differentiation)
- Dominant Bias: Specificity + Authority
- Hook Type: Science/Mechanism (Hook Type 2 from Titan)

COPY TEXT:
- Headline: "WHY GENERIC FIRST AID KITS FAIL WHEN IT MATTERS"
- Subhead: "The organization problem nobody talks about"
- Offer: "FREE SHIPPING — LIFETIME WARRANTY"
- CTA: "See What's Inside →" (orange button)
- Body: [full mechanism copy about color-coded compartments, EMT-curated contents...]
```

### Phase 2 Output
```
DESIGN BRIEF — SurviveX Kit Mechanism Ad

Layout:
- Pattern: #12 Educational Diagram
- Structure: Open kit center, 4 callout bubbles radiating out to compartments
- Rationale: L3 + mechanism hook → education about organization system converts

Color Palette:
- Background: dark gradient (#1A1A1A → #2D2D2D) — tactical authority
- Accent: safety orange (#FF6B00) — SurviveX brand color
- Typography: white on dark
- Rationale: Dark + orange = tactical premium positioning for S3 audience

Reference Images:
- MyMedic_42d_W_12345678.jpg — MyMedic, used_count: 5
- NAR_38d_W_87654321.jpg — NAR, used_count: 4

Gemini Prompt:
"Create a Facebook ad base image. Dark gradient background (#1A1A1A to #2D2D2D).
Center: open SurviveX first aid kit showing color-coded compartments with organized
medical supplies visible. Tactical/rugged aesthetic with warm accent lighting.
Leave clear space at top for headline text and around the kit for callout
bubbles. No text. No words. Premium tactical gear aesthetic. 1080×1350 at 4:5."
```

### Phase 3: Generate with Gemini (2 reference images + prompt)
### Phase 4: Composite using `mechanism-callouts.html` template
### Phase 5: QA against checklist → ship

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Gemini output doesn't match the pattern:**
→ Increase reference images to 3. Reduce text prompt length. Gemini's visual mimicry > text interpretation.

**Pattern doesn't exist in visual-patterns.md:**
→ Build prompt from `design-psychology.md` principles. Flag for addition to pattern library.

**Reference images not found in index:**
→ Check `pattern-reference-index.json`. If pattern has few/no images, use the closest pattern's images as references and describe the difference in the Gemini prompt.

**Text overlay looks wrong:**
→ Switch from Method C (Gemini) to Method A (HTML template). HTML gives pixel-perfect control.

**User wants a landing page section (not an ad):**
→ Switch to `fotw-design-patterns.md` for design reference. Phase 2 process is identical; pattern library differs.

## Production Method Routing (Phase 2 Addition)

Before generating, route each ad to the correct production method:

| Category | Patterns | Method |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **A: Gemini Scene** | 2, 9, 15, 19, 20 | Gemini generates scene with actual product photo input |
| **B: HTML Design** | 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 24, 25, 26 | Full HTML/CSS with real product photos — NO Gemini |
| **C: Real Content Only** | 21, 23 | Requires actual UGC/real photos. Cannot be AI-generated. |

## Quality Gate (Phase 3 Addition)

For Category A (Gemini Scene) ads:
1. Generate **5 variants** (temperature=1.0, parallel)
2. Score each with Gemini Vision (gemini-2.5-flash) on: product accuracy, layout quality, photography quality, scroll-stopping power (1-10 each)
3. Only use variants scoring ≥ 7/10 average
4. If none pass → fall back to Category B (HTML design)
